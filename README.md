This is a Spotify Downloader

It uses Spotify API (Spotipy) to get the data. Then it finds the names of tracks and searches them on YouTube. With this, it gets a link to a YouTube video, where the library pytube is used for downloading .mp3 files.
There are many factors that some tracks wouldn't work like the song is not on YouTube under the name, that it is on Spotify. In my case, it worked every time, when I tried it. 

Have fun :)
Also my first Repos.
