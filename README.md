This is a Spotify Downloader

It uses Spotify API (Spotipy) to get the data. Than it finds the name of tracks and searches them on youtube. With this it gets a link to a youtube video, where the library pytube is used for downloading .mp3 files.
There are many factors that for some tracks wouldn't work like the song is not on youtube under that name that it is on Spotify. In my case it worked everytime, when I tried it. 

Have fun :)
Also my first Repos.

Working on it:)
